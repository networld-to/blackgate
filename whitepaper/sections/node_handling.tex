All nodes assign priorities to its neighbor nodes in the overlay network.
The priority, which is a subjective metric, represents ratio of the response
messages, Transaction or a Block, requested from a specific host to the
overall responses (from all the hosts). \\
$score = \frac{receivedTransaction + receivedBlock}{allResponses}$



The host, which receives the response message, increments always the allResponses value but
only the receivedTransaction or receivedBlock one for the host whose message
arrived first.
