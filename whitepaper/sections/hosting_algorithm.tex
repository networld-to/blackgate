One of the key concepts in the \textit{Distributed Hosting} is the \textit{Hosting Algorithm}. 
The main challenge of a \textit{Distributed Hosting} environment is the dynamic structure of the network which changes frequently. The members of the network are free to join and leave with no restrictions and hence a huge movement is produced.Furthermore, the shape of the network has to conform in order to satisfy all the participants. Accordingly, a sophisticated \textit{Hosting Algorithm} is introduced for confronting to these challenges. 

More precisely, this algorithm has, first of all, to take care of the \textit{real-time} nature of the network.  







robustness

if the last block timestamp is older than a threshold value we remove the blockchain+page. 

if an update transaction with an empty snapshot arrives we remove blockchain+page.
